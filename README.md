# CCNA_Forti_G1
This project presents the design and implementation of a secure, segmented network infrastructure that integrates VLAN technology with FortiGate next-generation firewall solutions. The architecture effectively separates network traffic for the Human Resources (HR) and Information Technology (IT) departments, ensuring isolation while allowing controlled communication based on defined security policies. By utilizing FortiGate’s advanced capabilities, the network achieves fine-grained traffic regulation, strengthened security posture, and improved operational efficiency. The resulting design reflects industry-standard practices in enterprise segmentation and provides a scalable framework capable of supporting additional departments and future organizational expansion.
